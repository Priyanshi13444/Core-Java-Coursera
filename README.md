Code style (or programming style) is a set of rules used when writing code to ensure all the code is formatted in the same way.

Code can be written in different ways.

Even programs as simple as “Hello, world!” can look different:

# Unformatted:

public class
HelloWorld {public static
void main(
String[]args){System.out.println("Hello, world!");}}


# Formatted:

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}



# Code style could include:
curly braces
indents
parentheses
white space
naming conventions (e.g. classes, variables, methods)
maximum line length
